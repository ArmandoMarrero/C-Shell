.SH NAME
.B simple_shell
- Simple shell created in C to interact with a Linux operating system.

.SH SYNOPSIS
simple_shell [options] [file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The simple shell reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands. It is the program that is started when a user logs into the system. The shell incorporates features to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts).

.SH OVERVIEW
The simple shell is designed to provide users with a basic, interactive command-line interface for interacting with a Linux operating system. It supports executing both built-in commands and external programs. Users can input commands directly to the running simple shell or execute commands from a file, facilitating both interactive and scripted use.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The simple shell returns 0 for success; other numbers indicate failure.

.SH PATH
The shell looks inside all directories in the PATH environment variable for executables.

.SH OPTIONS
.B simple_shell
Command options are typed after the main command, followed by a space and a '-' symbol.

.SH EXAMPLE
[command] [options]
$ ls -l

.SH BUGS
A single space is required after an argument.
